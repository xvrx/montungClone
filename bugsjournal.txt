axios does not include cookie in req header =>
	if a cookie is set from localhost:2000 
	then it could only be set as a header upon requesting to localhost:2000
	the same goes for 10.13.1.64 (or any other network IP)
	do not fetch session ID from localhost and expect the cookie
	to be included upon fetching to 10.13.1.64
	even though localhost and network IP represents the same 
	address, but chrome (or some any other browser) will identify those as different
